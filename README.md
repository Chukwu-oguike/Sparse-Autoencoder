# Sparse-Autoencoder
In this project we implement a sparse autoencoder for image compression. In order to do this we implement the following steps


*   Implement forward propagation in a neural network, and implement the squared error term of the cost function.  Implement backpropagation to compute the derivatives.   Then (using lambda=beta=0), run Gradient Checking to verify that the calculations corresponding to the squared error cost term are correct.

*   Add in the weight decay term (in both the cost function and the derivative calculations), then re-run Gradient Checking to verify correctness.

*   Add in the sparsity penalty term, then re-run Gradient Checking to verify correctness.
